# Introduction
- Grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of each method, as well as a grasp of general concepts such as bias and variance, overfitting and underfitting, etc.
- Machine learning is a means of building models of data to better understand that

# Categories of Machine Learning
## Supervised learning:  
- Relationship between **measured features** of data and some **label** associated with the data
- Determine a model to desribe the relationship
- This model will be used to apply labels to new unknown data
### Classification 
Labels are discrete categrories
### Regression
Labels are continuous quantities

## Unsupervised Learning
- Modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label
- clustering: identify distinct groups of data
- Dimensionality reduction: search for more succinct representations of the data

## Semi-supervised learning
Often useful when only incomplete labels are available

# Qualitative Examples of Machine Learning Applications

## Classification : predicting discrete labels
